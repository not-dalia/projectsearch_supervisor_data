  **Project idea 1 - Understanding people's mental models around message
  deletion**


  What happens when we hit delete in a messaging app? Where is the message stored? Is it really deleted? Is it deleted everywhere? Could it be recovered? This project will use qualitative methods to understand how people think message deletion works in two or more messaging apps.


  *Skills: qualitative, interviews, cognitive walkthroughs, think alouds*


  **Project idea 2 - The influence of backgrounds on computer-mediated video interactions**


  With the COVID-19 moving many of our interactions online, we are video calling each other more than ever before. Unlike in person meetings, online meetings allow us to replace our background. But what affect might this have on how people interact with each other? This project is interested in how people's backgrounds (e.g., no filter, blurred, other) influence how people are perceived by others (e.g., interpersonal trust).


   Skills: *controlled quantitative experimental study, an exploratory qualitative study or mixed methods*


  **Project idea 3 - How design of police risk assessment systems influence decision-making** 


  The police are now using a variety of different algorithmically driven systems to help support decision-making. For example oxRec (<https://oxrisk.com/oxrec-9/>) calculates the risk of violent reoffending of released prisoners. What we do not know is how people (e.g., police officers) evaluate and process the outputs of these models, and make sense of them in order to support their decision-making. Could the design of these systems positively (or negatively) influence their decision-making. 


  Skills: *controlled quantitative study, an exploratory qualitative study or mixed methods*


  **Project idea 4 - Could subtle "nudges" be effective in reducing harmful online speech?**


  Hate speech online is growing year-on-year. One means of reducing hate speech is to develop indicators that inform people of their hurtful/harmful comments as they type. These indicators are often very explicit e.g. "Your message may hurt someone". But could more subtle "nudges" (see nudge theory) be more effective? e.g., could changes to interface colour or sound be used to discourage the typing of harmful content? 


  *Skills: controlled quantitative study, an exploratory qualitative study or mixed methods, coding most likely required to develop a prototype interface (e.g., python, java, react)*


  **Project idea 5 - Analysis of how police services in the UK are utilise social media**


  Understanding the differences in how police services utilise social media through an analysis of Twitter data (e.g., analysis of multiple policing account tweets in terms of their tone, sentiment, posting frequency, engagement).


  *Skills: quantitative study, coding required to identify and collect tweets and perform analysis across data, NLP/python.*
