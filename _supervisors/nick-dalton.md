  ### Also, I am good at working with students with disabilities ( dyslexia,
  autism spectrum, ADHD)


  ## BFL Future Programming languages for Beginners


  <https://github.com/sheepdalton/BFL>


  BFL (Big Falcon Language) or (Beginners Falcon Language) Is a new programming language inspired by HyperTalk and Python. It's designed to be a powerful and correct learner language. This is a work in progress.


  BFL is intended to be a full programming language - if you see the documentation you will see the developing tutorial. The language began by writing the tutorial not all aspects of the introduction exist or are certain to make it into version 1.0


  The MVP ( *Minimal Viable Product* ) is an interactive command line based calculator. It shows off some of the aspects of BFL philosophy which will be apparent in the final language. 


  You could test this out on students or write another backend or extend the language. 


  **Requires very good java programming skills, use of Netbeans IDE, Github**


  ## Interaction with public displays: emergency egress in airports. 


  ### (no programming if you don't mind working hard)


  Aim: the aim of this project is to analyze provided mobile eye-tracking video to measure the number of times that people notice a variety of public digital displays. Analysis of this information will lead to a better understanding of information displays positioning and information content. 


  Description: every year there is at least one major stampede of people leading to fatalities. Over 10,000 people have died since 2001, in Hillsborough and other events around the world. During disasters in large buildings and urban situations, it is vitally important to be able to dynamically inform pedestrians about which escape routes may be blocked. Underpinning all this is an understanding of how people notice displays in real-world situations.  This research project begins by taking provided mobile eye-tracking data from a route through airport. Using tools provided Digital displays will be identified/coded to provide information about which displays were noticed and others not noticed. Once the data has been coded then this information will be analysed to understand how Digital displays should be used.

  ## Big Data visualization for diabetes patients


   AIM: to take given data recorded from a patient with diabetes. Develop visualization mechanisms that will create insight into the reasons for blood glucose levels fluctuation. Test visualization mechanisms for their ability to gain insight.


  Description: Type 1 Diabetes is a serious condition that demands careful balancing of lifestyle and medication to avoid serious complications. Current mobile health approaches for diabetes management are usually either automated insulin delivery systems or logbooks that depend on manual data collection and reflection. Both have their shortcomings such as loss of engagement and autonomy in the former approach, or fatigue and cognitive stress in the latter. 


  Developments in continuous blood glucose monitoring brings more information than ever before to the patient hands. The urgent problem is trying to interpret this information such that the patient and the doctor are able to create insight into the causes of blood glucose level fluctuation. This project will begin with a dataset of a variety of measured values taken from a real patient with diabetes. The objective will be to create a number of visualizations ( possibly interactive ) that look at the data in new ways with the ambition of creating new insights.


  Once the visualization are created they will be tested to observe the effectiveness of insight creation.
