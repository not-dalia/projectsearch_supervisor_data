  The project ideas I'm interested in this year include:


  1 Untraceable payment system

   Mobile payment systems enable smartphone users to pay for a product/service without using physical cards or cash. Privacy violation can take place either on the mobile end, or even worse, on the Service Provider end. To protect user privacy against the third-party Service Provider (e.g. Amazon), researchers have started to design "untraceable" payment systems using cryptography techniques, such as blind signature. Untraceable payment systems can guarantee fair and secure transactions between customers and merchants without exposing the linkage to the Service Provider. We have proposed such a system.

  If you're interested in data privacy and cryptography, and good at programming in Java or Python,  we would like you to develop a prototype for our system.



  2 Private recommendation systems


  Recommendation systems play a key role in today's e-commerce platforms. Recommendations are performed by analysing users' purchase historic data and personal profiles. It has been revealed that the service providers collect more data than required.  Even ethical data aggregation and analytics can violate user privacy. 


  Students will investigate state-of-the-art privacy-preserving measures and deep-learning recommendation algorithm, and develop a prototype for a private recommendation system. Knowledge in machine learning/deep learning and programming in python are essential.


  3 IoT Protocol design and simulation in Network Simulator 3 (NS3):


  Design/modify network protocols to solve existing issues in current IoT networks. The protocols need to be implemented in a research network simulator, e.g. NS3. Experiments need to be run to show the performance improvement.
