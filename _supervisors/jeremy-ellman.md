  ### Natural Language Processing (NLP)


  NLP is the computer processing or generation of language. The text in italics was generated by GPT2:


  **I am more interested in Deep Learning**  *than deep learning in AI.  My only concern with Deep Learning is  how well it can learn from  or on  the information from previous   (or previous  as they go).  That is a complex question of probability.  And while learning is highly correlated with  knowledge in my sense  from  or without  deep learning ,  it is far less correlated.*


  *Deep learning is a highly integrated technology in the world of computer science and IT.  But for the majority of the working population, it will not be good enough.  If a single machine can learn on its own by themselves, then it can learn in a single, integrated manner.  That is what Deep Learning has always been.  Every system needs a  separate  user.  Each user has a different set of skills, needs and beliefs.*


  *The good news is that  Deep Learning  is well on its way and we know that it will continue to evolve into a robust, fast, secure, and low cost solution for information processing.  The question is: why?  Why is learning more fun than it used to be?  Is it a problem for most programmers and the average person, or is it just a bad thing to have? A good answer is that it is so very different from what it used to be in the first place.*
