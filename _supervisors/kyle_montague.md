  I'm keen to supervise projects that you are passionate about. If you've got an
  idea and looks like I've got relevant experience and interests then get in
  touch. 


  Likewise if you're not exactly sure on a suitable topic yet feel free to have a look at my recent works / publications to see the types of research I'm involved in. 


  You can see some of the active projects (we can develop a new project idea that aligns with any of these):


  * <https://colospeed.uk/> – Digital technologies to support colorectal cancer research

  * <https://enablingongoingness.com/> – Digital/Physical interaction design around end of life and bereavement 

  * <https://www.digitalcitizens.uk/> – exploring the role of digital technologies with respect to community engagement, democracy, discrimination, politics and action.

  * <https://cue.band/> – wearable technologies to improve the quality of life for people living with Parkinson's Disease.

  * <https://techandpeople.github.io/wildkey/> – Privacy aware mobile keyboard data collection for research studies.


  Finally, here are some ideas that I'm currently discussing with my research team in NorSC. 


  ## Human-Data Interaction


  **Food inequalities:** What are the impacts of Covid-19 and '*pingdemic*' on food security in the UK? Interesting to look at this in relation to socioeconomic indicators. 


   *Available datasets:*


  * The Trussell Trust foodbank locations

  * Asda supermarket’s locations

  * E-food desert index

  * Index of Multiple Deprivations on LSOA level

  * Scraped data from Asda API on availably and price of [essential food items](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trusselltrust.org%2Fget-help%2Femergency-food%2Ffood-parcel%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckyle.montague%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Cd4b5823b5bdc408ba84308d95c0b149d%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637642024916783228%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=huNroaqAy4sX3oiunt3m0FoGck6Am2PPkfq%2BmjtxuLg%3D&reserved=0) from shops located in IMD decile 1.

Published 2020 May 13. doi:10.35241/emeraldopenres.13539.2 - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219559/](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC7219559%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckyle.montague%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Cd4b5823b5bdc408ba84308d95c0b149d%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637642024916793181%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=wNtupjJ9R3u8aLEs%2F8lwtYSGEo40q1GlOqUcgD1SoO8%3D&reserved=0)


  **Right to roam:** Right to roam is a law that allows members of the public access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for recreation and exercise. With the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 people in England were given freedom to roam on 8% of the land. Last year over 100 authors, musicians, and actors [signed an open letter](https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/letter) to the PM Boris Johnson to call for extending people’s rights to roam.  


  There are also strict rules around wild camping in the UK. Most part of England and Wales it is illegal to wild camp. Although people still wild camp following the rules of arrive late, leave early and leave no trace. However, not all people follow these rules and there have been incidents which have resulted in harsher restrictions - <https://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/crime/kielder-bans-wild-camping-after-rubbish-dumped-park-2909142>

  How could freedom to roam be extended to enable people responsible enjoy the outdoors and recreational activates? Who can take advantage of this right? What would be solutions for extending the rights, keeping people accountable and helping safeguard nature? What data can be used or collected to explore this?


  **New models of data sharing:** Sharing data usually done via push or pull protocols, using a predefined code, authentication methods and REST API. How can we reimagine data sharing using trigger methods? For example, using “If This, Then That” (IFTTT) channels and to create recipes. What data can be shared using this trigger model? What are benefits and implications for individual and group privacy?

  ## Virtual Reality areas of interest


  Locomotion: There are many different mechanisms to move around in VR, as these environments grow, we need to explore novel forms of movement and teleportation, walking and even visual tricks to move around.


  Social VR: As VR becomes more social, we create new opportunities for interactions with others; however, the current interfaces are predominantly design for single user interactions. What interactions work well with others? How do we democratise conversation and other essentials of working and being together? How do collective gestures work etc.? 


  Shared Experiences: Collective video watching and live events in VR present an interesting design space for social interactions. What aspects of this physical shared experiences can be captured in VR? and what new affordances does VR offer?


  Social Media: How might we reimagine social media platforms inside Virtual Reality. What do the big players look like when reimagined for more immersive spaces – Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok. Does this content look like information spaces or is it much closer to home – friendly collegial café environments.


  Bots: How do bots work inside VR? What special affordances or opportunities in VR can we make use of? What don’t we want to see brought over e.g., customer bots?
