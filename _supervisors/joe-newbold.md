  **I will be taking on a range of projects surrounding technolgy for physical
  activtiy and wellbeing and the use of music and auditory display in computing.
  Below are some of the projects i am hoping to supervise, but please get in
  touch if you have a similar project idea.**




  **Music at work**


  Investigative projects on how workers/students use music to help them focus and take breaks by deploying our prototype tool with participants : <https://radio.eworklife.co.uk/register> this will involve study design, developing study materials and data analysis.


  **Digital behaviour change design concepts**


  Investigative project exploring behaviour change design concepts. We already have a good idea as to how to design “goal setting” and “reward” features, however there are a number of behaviour change techniques that we don’t have concrete design concepts for. This will involve an app review of select behaviour change applications and the development of new design materials which incorporate new behaviour change techniques.


  **Sonification**


  This project will examine the development of sonifications, i.e. auditory displays, that help people reflect on their physical activity data. This will involve developing sonifications using a range of audio-based prototypes and exploring how they help people understand their own activity.


  **Conversational interfaces**


  This project will examine how we design voice based conversational agents, such as Alexa or google assistant. This voice agents are usually designed to appear as human like as possible, this investigative project will examine how non-voice sounds can be used to lower people expectations of these agents and how that impacts their frustration when it makes errors
