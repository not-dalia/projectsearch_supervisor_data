  I am happy to discuss ideas related to:


  * Games development

  * Web development

  * Mobile development 

  * Digital health and wellbeing

  * Anything else


  I am happy to hear ideas (especially ones that relate to your life experiences, hobbies, passions, outside interests, industry experience, big ideas, strange dreams, etc). 


  Here's a few ideas of my own:


  * (Software Engineering / General project) Build an “experience sampling” application that will capture information about what someone is doing or thinking at random times of day (see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method).

  * (Investigative project) Systematically review the functionality and usability of mobile applications for managing an addiction or a chronic condition (You might learn how to use a scraper such as this - https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/ to collect data) (See e.g. https://mental.jmir.org/2020/1/e15321/ https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10353/)

  * (General project) Build a digital board game or an interactive narrative for learning about or exploring an event, a concept, or some aspect of the world (see e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3322276.3323697 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3418038 )

  * (General project) Build a web or mobile application for tracking expenditure, food, or productivity. You might think about building upon behaviour change techniques or using intervention design methods.

  * (General project) A game, web app or mobile app that helps students practice mindfulness techniques or improve their mood (see e.g https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025590 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3334480.3382938)

  * (Investigative / General project) Something that will try to influence your dreams or build upon dreaming (see e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173917 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2663806.2663874 )

  * (General project) Create a web application or game to support researchers using the 'story completion method' (see http://oro.open.ac.uk/48404/3/IQR%20SC%20Chapter%20-%20FINAL.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461778.3462069)


  Please note that I expect to hold most supervision meetings online (using MS Teams) this year - which I thought worked very well for one-to-one project supervision last year. I am not against face-to-face supervision, but if this is important to you please discuss this with me before making a choice.
