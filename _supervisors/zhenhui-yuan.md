  **Dr.Zhenhui Yuan**


  I was a network engineer, a spin-off entrepreneur, and now an academic at the CyberNets research group in Northumbria University. I have been working on mobile networking technologies for over ten years. In my view, network is a fundamental infrastructure on the planet and plays the same role as gas and electricity. Internet itself is a giant network that consists of millions of computers. 


  If you would like to play with networking technology (and you will enjoy!), I’d love to offer helps and advices (not exactly “supervise”). We can explore some amazing idea together.


  For the purpose of inspiration, I’m sharing three research directions below.


  1. **Multimedia streaming**
     open questions: *how is a 4K movie streamed from Netflix cloud to your mobile? What is the standard video streaming protocol being used Internet? What may happen if the network is poor, e.g. you are on the motor way?* 
     A project on multimedia streaming will learn and investigate the performance of variable streaming protocols. Simulations or real-world tests could be developed to study the quality-of-service or quality-of-experience of different streaming protocols in terms of devices, mobility, video quality, etc.
  2. **Vehicular communications**
     open questions: *How can 5G network help self-driving cars? How to ensure a swarm of UAVs communicate with each other timely and accurately? What are the benefits from vehicle-to-vehicle communications?*
     A project on vehicular communications focuses on the methodologies to interconnect a vehicle with other vehicles, road-side unit, edge, cloud, pedestrians, cyclists and so on. The concept of vehicle is broad including UAVs, robotic rovers, self-driving cars, and underwater vehicles. These vehicles can be used in many applications such as delivery, search and rescue, and sensor data collection. You will design and develop a tailored network for a specific vehicle and prove that your network can satisfy the application’s network demands. 
  3. **Network protocol stack**
     open questions: *Why does Apple use multipath TCP in Siri and Apple maps? Why does Netflix use TCP to stream video instead of UDP? Why does Google Chrome use QUIC protocol? Which routing protocol do you recommend for a team of robotic rovers on Mars? What would be the challenges when you have one UAV to collect data from one thousand sensors on the farm?*
     This type of project gives you a chance to deeply understand the know-how of computer network. You will learn the theories of standard network protocols at multiple OSI layers (application/transport/network/data link/physical layer). You will dive into the algorithms and conduct deep analysis of protocols in terms of QoS (e.g. delay, loss, throughput, fairness, network utilization, etc). You will implement the protocol in either simulation or real-world testbed.
     You’re always more encouraged to bring up your own idea!

     **My previous supervised projects (selected)**

     “Secure Design and Implementation for a Local Area Network” \[General Computing Project]

     “Developing a Web-based Voice Control System for Robotic Vehicle” \[General Computing Project]

     “Extracting email attachments from a mail server and examining the Macros” \[General Computing Project]
     For your convenience, I can provide Raspberry Pi and robotic rovers in case you need for real-world tests.

  If you take a fancy to computer networking technology and wonder how it can change our life, why not drop me an email! I’m always open and happy to have a chat!
