  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education - this is across the whole education system from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can enhance and innovate the education and the student experience for computer science and digital technology students. Finally I have worked on projects that have explored how to provide a more inclusive educational environment and how we can ensure that everyone irrespective of their background or experiences is digitally fluent, both here in the UK and globally.
