  My research interests are in Machine Learning for activity recognition (ML for
  AR) whatever the domain or activity. This involves data capture from sensor
  networks, images and video. I will supervise the following projects based
  around 2 categories: Machine Learning (ML) and general software development
  (SD). If you have any ideas of your own related to ML for AR, I'm happy to
  discuss these with you.\


  **ML_Project1: Sign Language interpretation:**

  You will investigate and provide a proof of concept using the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for interpreting sign language from images.


  **ML_Project2: Animal recognition and identification:**

  You will investigate and provide a proof of concept using the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for recognition and identification of specific animals in a herd.  


  **ML_Project3: Human pose estimation for sport:**

  Using publicly available data you will investigate and demonstrate the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for analysing human pose in sport. The aim here is to be able to indicate where an athlete can improve posture, position and technique within the range of known ideals.   


  **ML_Project4: FOREX market prediction:**

  Using publicly available data you will investigate and demonstrate the state of the art in time series Machine learning techniques for predicting the direction of currency pairs on the foreign exchange market.  


  **SD_project: Development of a golf distance measuring application:**

  You will develop a software application that will allow the user to click two points on a golf course and provide distance measurements for use in range finding.
