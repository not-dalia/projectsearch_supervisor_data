  **Genetic programming approaches to the solution of Sokoban puzzles**


  Sokoban is a puzzle game involving an actor pushing boxes one-at-a-time on a fixed grid until they are all on target cells.  The full standard set of 90 screens (problem instances) has only recently been solved for the first time by heuristic methods.  The project will investigate the use of genetic programming as an alternative solution method.  Genetic programming is an evolutionary algorithm approach for the evolution of computer programs to solve problems across a wide range of domains.  Both a Java implementation of the Sokoban game, and existing Java frameworks for genetic programming are available.  There would be some potential for publication of a successful project.


  **Genetic algorithms for the orthogonal rectangular layout optimisation problem**


  Laying out and packing a set of weighted rectangular objects within a circle is analogous to many real-world problems, such as designing a satellite for launch.  This project will utilise genetic algorithms, and perhaps other evolutionary approaches, to solve the problem where the weighted rectangles must be packed orthogonally (edges touching) within a circular area and with their overall centre of gravity balanced.  The project will be able to build on earlier work in Java with the weighted circles in a circular area problem.  There would be some potential for publication of a successful project.


  **Improving the speed of grammatical evolution for explainable AI**


  One of the approaches to evolutionary computation is genetic programming, the evolution of computer programs to solve problems across a wide range of domains.  In recent years, a variant on this emphasising the use of grammatically constrained program trees, called grammatical evolution, has been gaining popularity.  This approach promises to encourage more human understandable solutions to problems: explainable AI.  The project will aim to either implement grammatical evolution or adopt a pre-existing framework, and explore ways to improve the execution speed to allow even more complex problems to be solved.  There would be some potential for publication of a successful project.


  **Generating large  Futoshiki problems with unique solutions**


  Futoshiki is a Japanese pencil puzzle similar to Sudoku. However, rather than placing numbers uniquely in rows, columns and boxes, as in Sudoku, Futoshiki puzzles have unique numbers only in rows and columns, but also have ‘relations’. The numbers in certain cells are marked as either less than or greater than those in an adjacent cell. While solving large Futoshiki puzzles is challenging in its own right, this project will seek to generate new large (i.e. more than 9x9) Futoshiki puzzles that have demonstrably unique solutions.


  **Heuristic approaches to routing and spectrum allocation in elastic optical networks**


  Elastic optical networks (EONs) are a recent development in optical transport networks, moving away from rigid constrains on optical slots (50 GHz) to allow flexible allocation of spectrum (multiples of, say, 6.25 GHz) as demands are routed across an optical network. Routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) for such EONs, whether the demands are statically or dynamically applied, is a complex combinatorial optimisation problem.  Employing a pre-existing software model for EONs written in Java, this project will aim to implement and compare the best heuristics that have so far been developed for RSA.  There would be some potential for publication of a successful project.


  **Bat algorithm approaches to combinatorial optimisation**


  An interesting naturally-inspired algorithm for the solution of continuous optimisation problems is the bat algorithm, inspired by the prey pursuit behaviour of flocks of bats feeding on airborne insects.  The algorithm blends elements of particle swarm optimisation and simulated annealing.  The aim of the project would be to adapt and develop the bat algorithm (as has already been attempted by some authors) to tackle combinatorial optimisation problems, as well as establishing how competitive the resulting algorithms is with, say, genetic algorithms on suitable problem benchmarks.  There would be some potential for publication of a successful project.
