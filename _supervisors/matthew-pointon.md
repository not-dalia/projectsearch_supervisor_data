  I am an UX designer with a particular passion in user testing and UX design;
  my research is principally in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and
  Information Retrieval (IR). My research addresses the significant interaction
  and retrieval challenges facing users and designers within an age of
  ubiquitous computing. 



  From an information science perspective, I am interested in the role that misinformation has on human behaviour and currently involved in a range of studies evaluating the impact of misinformation, disinformation and blatant fake news has on interaction behaviour and well-being online.



  As a side-line, which could support project ideas within CIS, is my interest and engagement with regional businesses partially as they test and evaluate digital products. These ongoing collaborations could support project ideas with potential tangible outputs for students as they create portfolio of digital products and evidence to support future.
