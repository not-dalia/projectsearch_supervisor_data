  I’m running the **Why Lab (**https://shanfenghu.github.io/**)** at Northumbria
  University to work on public & cooperate & personalized policymaking, with the
  applications on real-world processes (e.g., low-carbon policy, supply chains,
  smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance, education analytics, healthcare
  analytics) for socio-economic value creation. The core of our research is
  combining expert knowledge, digital twin simulation, causal reasoning and
  machine learning to seek fair and high-quality decision making of AI systems
  in various domains. Topics include but are not limited to:


  \- *Smart Manufacturing* (supply chain, predictive maintenance, dental health products)


  \- *Healthcare Analytics* (community care services, personalized medicines, digital health management)


  \- *Climate Change* (low-carbon policymaking, environmental disruptions, natural disater prediction)


  \- *Epidemiology* (pathogen forecast, vaccine takeup, biological causal networks)


  \- *Artificial Intelligence* (causal reasoning, machine learning, deep learning, lifelong learning)
