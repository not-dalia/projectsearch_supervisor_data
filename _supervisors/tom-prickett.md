  My research interests are mostly around computing education. Feel free to send
  me an an email with some idea of when you are free and very happy to arrange a
  time for a conversation. In terms of projects very happy to supervise:


  1. Client based projects - if you have a client you want to build something for, for example whoever you completed your placement for, or a local club or society or something you want to prototype as you are considering setting up your own business next year. Typically these are software engineering / development projects. 

  2. Projects with an educational dimension. Please remember all our projects have to include the use of the practical skills you have learned on your Programme of study.
