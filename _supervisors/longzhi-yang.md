  Hi, 




  hope you are well. You are welcome to contact me if you have any good idea to apply or innovate AI to various applications, such as healthcare, computer vision, robotics, engineering, cybersecurity, forensics etc. You are particularly welcome if you'd like to take a challenge project and I have supported multiple UG graduates to get full PhD scholarships form multiple universities, including Russel Group Universities such as York University and Newcastle University. You are welcome to bring your own ideas or take my "live" projects based on the scenarios that I learned from our industry partners. The industry projects have helped multiple students to get their jobs based on their impressive performance during final year projects.




  Best regards,


  Longzhi
